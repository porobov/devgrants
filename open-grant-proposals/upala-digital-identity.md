# **Open Grant Proposal: Upala Digital Identity**

**Name of Project: Upala Digital Identity**

**Proposal Category:** app-dev

**Proposer:** porobov (https://github.com/porobov)

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** "Yes"

# **Project Description**

Upala - proof of person-hood system. It provides human uniqueness scores to DApps. User score is valued in dollars and equals to the cost of forging the account. It is generated iteratively thanks to the initiatives encoded into protocol.

With Upala, DApps receive very reliable and clear metrics of how much a user values their ID. Existing anti-Sybil systems can use Upala as an additional quality control and incentives layer. With Upala, any human-verification method can be monetized.

## **Value**

A reliable anti-sybil system is crucial for projects dealing with voting, UBI, advertisement, loans, etc. Quadratic funding/voting could be more fair. Lending platform could use Upala ID as collaterial and thus provide cheaper services. Upala can also expand beyond web3, replace CAPTCHAs and KYCs. Solving the unique human problem will bring a variety of new usecases to blockchains and will boost adoption in the long run. After crypto-currencies, decentralized sctorage and smart contracts a truly decentralized digital identity is probably the next big step towards a better society.

As identity is a very sensible point, one of the risks of not making this project right is to give too much control to a single entity. That is why grants are important. 

The difficult part of this project is the interoperability of components, but I'd rather call it a challenge, not a risk.

## Deliverables

Upala protocol, tools, libraries and user DApp as specified in Upala [infrastructure](https://www.notion.so/Upala-infrastructure-9f9a09ea9f6b451fb8d39ea85ad5d5f2). 

Users will be able to create Upala ID, join groups and use their scores in DApps. 

DApps will be able to use Upala scores in their smart contracts or with no on-chain approval if they wish to. 

Anyone will be able to create Upala group around any human-verification method and start monetizing it.

## **Development Roadmap**

The roadmap is available [here](https://www.notion.so/66cc454c551847d2aa3666b9782dfeb0) (please check Progress and Cost views of the table). 

## **Total Budget Requested**

- Smart contracts and - $47,500 
- User front-end - $15,000
- DApp libs and API - $12,500
- Tool for managing groups - $12,500
- Centralized storage - $2,500 
- Smart contract audit - $20,000

**Total:** $110,000 (including $20,000 audit)

## **Maintenance and Upgrade Plans**

Planning to issue a native token that will mint regularly into team treasury. When the protocol becomes profitable, will use the income to fund further development.

## **Relevant Experience**

As I'm the sole full-time team member, the most important thing to note IMO is that I've been an entrepreneur the most of my life. Founded and co-founded startups in 3d-printing, [art](https://github.com/porobov/Concrete-Clock-1355) and [drones](https://supercam.aero/). Created a [charity project on Ethereum](https://themillionetherhomepage.com/). Learned to code while reading books and building tools for the 3d-printing company (sold it in the long run).

# **Additional Information**

Upala's mission is to unite people. Our goal is to provide identity to those who are deprived of it (>1bln people in the world). Upala is a very important project for humanity and for peace.
